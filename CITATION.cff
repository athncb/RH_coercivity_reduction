title: "Reduction of the Riemann Hypothesis to a Single Coercive Inequality (IU)"
abstract: >
  We provide an explicit reduction of the Riemann Hypothesis (RH) to a single
  coercive inequality (IU) with explicit constants, a constructed anchored kernel,
  and a quantified resonant test. The repository includes a fully reproducible
  package (scripts, data, hashes). This is not a proof of RH; it documents
  an explicit equivalence RH â‡” (IU) within the stated analytic framework.
